<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted a personal website of my own while also learning about AWS. I decided to achieve both by creating this project. Through this project, I was able to learn about full-stack software development, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, continuous integration and delivery, cloud services and “serverless”, application security, and networking.
